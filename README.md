# WebScraping_Shopping_Data
This project automates the extraction of product details from Google Shopping using Selenium and Pandas. It takes a list of item names from an Excel file, searches them on Google Shopping, extracts details such as product title, price, and website name, and saves the results in an output Excel file.
